# Machine learning

These tutorials use Pytorch and Jupyter notebooks to show to how you can implement Machine Learning for astronomy projects.

## Starting Jupyter

Run the script
```bash
./start_jupyter.sh
```

This will start the notebook and open the browser at the appropriate place on the disk.

Do the tutorials in the following order:

1. **using_jupyter_notebook.ipynb**

   This notebook will give you a quick overview on how to use the notebook
   
2. **cifar10_tutorial.ipynb**

   This notebook will show you how to create a convolution neural network using Pytorch
   
3. **spotting_rfi.ipynb**

   This notebook uses data from the Giant Millimetre Radio Telescope in India.
   The task is to separate RFI from general noise
